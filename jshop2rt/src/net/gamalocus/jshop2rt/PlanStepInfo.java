/**
 * This object encapsulates the information pertaining to a single step in the planning
 * process.  A sequence of these objects stored in a list represents the
 * steps taken during the process of finding a plan.  The step represented by this 
 * object is determined by the type of action that is being performed.  There 
 * are 6 types of actions: SETGOALTASKS, TRYING, REDUCED, STATECHANGED, BACKTRACKING,
 * and PLANFOUND. Depending on which action is being performed, a different subset of 
 * the fields in PlanStepInfo must be set as follows:
 * 
 * During a "SETGOALTASKS" step:
 *  - children: set to represent the goal task list
 *  - ordered: set to true if goal task list is ordered; false otherwise
 * 
 * During a "TRYING" step:
 *  - taskAtom: set to the current task atom (and its bindings) being tried (or !!INOP)
 *  - action: set to "TRYING"
 *  - state: set to a list of strings representing the current state of the world
 *  
 * During a "REDUCED" step:
 *  - taskAtom: set to the current task atom (and its bindings) being reduced 
 *  - action: set to "REDUCED"
 *  - method: set to method being used to reduce current task atom
 *  - preconditions: set to the preconditions that need to be satisfied to use method
 *  - children: set to a list of strings representing the task atoms that are the children
 *  - ordered: set to false if the current task atom is unordered.  True otherwise.
 *  
 * During a "STATECHANGED" step:
 *  - taskAtom: set to the top task that is changing the state
 *  - delAdd: set to a vector of 4 vectors that represent added & deleted atoms & protections
 *  - operatorInstance: set to the string representing 'taskAtom' after it's variables are instantiated
 *  
 * During a "BACKTRACKING" step:
 *  - taskAtom: set to the task atom that you are currently bactracking from
 *  
 * During a "PLANFOUND" step:
 *  - planFound: set to true  
 *
